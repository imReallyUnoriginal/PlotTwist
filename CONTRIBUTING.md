# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through [beginner issues](https://github.com/imReallyUnoriginal/plottwist/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner).

# Getting started

1. Ensure there is an open issue for the change
2. Create your own fork of the code
3. Make the changes in your fork
4. If you're happy with the change and think it improves the project, create a pull request

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email isaacconnor01@gmail.com instead.

When creating an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- What version of PHP (php -v) and Laravel (php artisan --version) are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

The philosophy for this project is to use high-level abstraction to make charts as easy to work with as possible.

If you want PlotTwist to have a feature it currently doesn't, open an issue on GitHub that describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how you think it should work.
